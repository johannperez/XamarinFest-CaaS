# XamarinFest-CaaS
This is a really simple project to learn abot CaaS and share on the Xamarin Fest Latam Montevideo

Lots of information needed to set this project and documentation is taken from: https://github.com/xamarinFest/Contenido-Eventos

The project consists of a simple bot service to enable users to register for prices which we gave away in the meetup.
